        Hi there! I'm James. I'm applying for this program because I'd like to
        pursue a career in web development, and Founders and Coders really stood
        out as the right choice for me. The idea of going through the system
        twice, once learning and then teaching sounds fantastic - a really great
        opportunity to give back everything that was given to you. I was also
        really drawn to the groupwork focus of FAC, as I love working with other
        people, and learn much better when I'm building stuff.

            I graduated with a first class degree from UCL, but after 3 years of
            studying chemistry I knew that I didn't want to do it for the rest
            of my life. The thing that I really loved about chemistry was
            solving rigorous problems which required more than just knowledge -
            they needed a little bit of creativity and inspiration too. I loved
            the 'aha!' moments that I got, but I really didn't like lab work
            because I'm pretty clumsy - so I looked around for the right career
            and really fell in love with coding! It scratches that problem
            solving itch for me, and I like the idea of a job where you can
            never stop learning.

            I love to cycle! It's the only way I get around London nowadays (not
            that there's much getting around to do anymore!). After graduation
            last June, I started tutoring science in underprivileged schools
            full time - and because I had to spend hours on public transport
            going between the different schools, I really started to hate the
            job and the hustle and bustle of London. When I got my bike, the
            city opened up and now I can't even imagine taking the tube anymore!

            I've played guitar for about 10 years now, and have been playing in
            a band for the last 2 with my best friend John. I love the feeling
            of going into a practice room and trying to make music with the
            band, when it clicks and everybody is in the groove it feels like
            magic! That's the one thing I'm missing the most from lockdown...
